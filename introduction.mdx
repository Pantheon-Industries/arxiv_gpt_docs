## Overview

Welcome to the arXiv Machine-Readable Paper API, a developer-friendly tool for converting academic papers into accessible formats.

We provide access to 1,000,000+ arXiv papers, with data going back 30+ years.

You can use our API to power your AI research assistants, literature review tools, academic search engines, and more.

You are welcome to save and use any data that you receive from our API. Our platform is built by developers for developers.

## Getting Started

Please create an account and get your API key at [arxiv-api.example.com](https://arxiv-api.example.com).

You will use the API key to authenticate your requests. The full list of available paper IDs is [here](https://arxiv-api.example.com/paper-ids).

For testing purposes, data for the following paper IDs is free: 2101.00123, 2102.04567, 2103.08910, 2104.11213, 2105.14151.

There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:

1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `paper_id`, `format`, and `max_pages` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

Note: `paper_id` and `format` are required. By default, `max_pages` is set to all pages.

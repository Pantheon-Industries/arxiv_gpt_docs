## 👋 Overview

The arXivGPT Paper API offers a powerful solution for converting any arXiv paper into Markdown or plain text formats. Allowing you the following:

- Power AI agents with structured scientific content
- Build custom applications leveraging arXiv paper data
- Enhance research workflows and data analysis
- Explore and experiment with scientific literature in machine-readable formats

## 🚀 Getting Started

Our API is powered by RapidAPI, ensuring a smooth and secure integration process. Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. **Obtain API Credentials**: 
   - Subscribe to our API and get your key from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/swift-api-swift-api-default/api/claude-3-haiku-ai).

2. **Prepare Your Request**:
   - Add your RapidAPI credentials to the request header:
     - `X-API-Key`
     - `x-rapidapi-host`
     - `x-rapidapi-key`
   - Include query parameters:
     - `paper_id` (required): The arXiv paper identifier
     - `num_pages` (optional): Number of pages to return

3. **Make the API Call**:
   - Choose between Markdown or plain text endpoints
   - Execute your request and receive the converted paper data

## 💻 Code Examples

Here are sample code snippets to help you get started quickly:

<CodeGroup>
```python Markdown
import requests

url = "https://arxivgpt.p.rapidapi.com/papers/markdown/"
querystring = {"paper_id": "2408.01800", "num_pages": "5"}
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "<YOUR_X_API_KEY>",
    "x-rapidapi-host": "<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST>",
    "x-rapidapi-key": "<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY>"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
print(response.text)
```

```python Plain Text
import requests

url = "https://arxivgpt.p.rapidapi.com/papers/text/"
querystring = {"paper_id": "2408.01800", "num_pages": "5"}
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "<YOUR_X_API_KEY>",
    "x-rapidapi-host": "<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST>",
    "x-rapidapi-key": "<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY>"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
print(response.text)
```
</CodeGroup>

## 📊 API Response

Our API returns the converted paper content along with metadata. Here's a sample response structure:

```json
{
  "paper_id": "2408.01800",
  "content": "# Introduction\n\nThis is the converted paper content...",
  "format": "markdown",
  "pages_returned": 5,
  "total_pages": 15
}
```

## 🛠 Use Cases

1. **Build AGI**: Power your AGI with structured scientific content
1. **AI-Powered Literature Review**: Train models on structured paper data for automated summarization and analysis.
2. **Custom Search Engines**: Build specialized search tools for scientific literature.
3. **Data Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations of research trends and connections.
4. **Accessibility Tools**: Convert papers to more accessible formats for screen readers or text-to-speech applications.
